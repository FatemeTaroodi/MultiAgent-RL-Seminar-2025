## 🧭 Seminar Roadmap

1. **Introduction to MARL**  
   - Definition: Multiple agents interacting in a shared environment  
   - Comparison with single‑agent RL  
   - Importance and applications: robotics, swarm systems, traffic control, economics, multi-agent games

2. **Foundational Concepts**  
   - Core ideas from game theory: cooperative, competitive, and mixed settings  
   - Equilibrium and optimality: Nash equilibrium, Pareto optimality

3. **MARL Environment Types**  
   - Fully Observable (MDP) vs Partially Observable (Dec‑POMDP)  
   - Centralized vs Decentralized training & execution  
   - Communication and coordination challenges among agents

4. **Algorithm Categories**  
   - **Independent Learners** (e.g., Independent Q‑Learning – IQL)  
   - (Other algorithm categories can be appended or expanded later)
